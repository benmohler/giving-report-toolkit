  <div class="pain-grid">
    <div class="pain-item">
      <strong>“Why aren’t my board and leadership aligned?”</strong>
      <p>Because they’re being shown disconnected data. The Executive Insight Deck brings everyone to the same page—literally.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pain-item">
      <strong>“How do I know where to focus my team’s energy?”</strong>
      <p>The Action Workbook maps your top opportunities and helps teams prioritize donor outreach without needing a data analyst.</p>

    <div class="pain-item">
      <strong>“We don’t know who our best donors actually are.”</strong>
      <p>The Insight Report surfaces top donor segments based on real giving behavior—not assumptions—so you know who to thank, upgrade, or re-engage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pain-item">
      <strong>“Our strategy is too reactive. Every campaign feels last-minute.”</strong>
      <p>The Toolkit helps you plan around donor behavior and giving patterns. Use the Action Workbook to get ahead with proactive, data-backed moves.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pain-item">
      <strong>“Our reports take forever to develop and are harder to explain.”</strong>
      <p>The Executive Insight Deck translates complex data into plain language and charts. Board members, leadership, and staff get what they need—at a glance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pain-item">
      <strong>“Our team spends hours pulling lists that still miss people.”</strong>
